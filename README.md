# OpenTrickler v2

Tested and working on Pico 2 W

## Version History

**v2.0** – Introduced AI tuning.

**v2.1** – Fixed dropdown lists to correctly display profile names.

**v2.2** – Updated Wi-Fi configuration to persist settings in flash memory.

**v2.3** – Eliminated silent failures by adding clear error messages.

**v2.4** – Updated and refined the web pages.

## Getting Started

Users can now flash the firmware and have the entire application load in AP mode. From there, they can configure their own Wi-Fi and immediately navigate the app.

As additional hardware is connected, error conditions will naturally reduce.

**Important:** Always add or remove hardware while the Pico is powered off / disconnected.
